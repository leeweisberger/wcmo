          <h3 class="grey-text text-darken-3">Litigation</h3>
          <p>
            The professional aggressiveness which characterizes Williams Caliri Miller & Otley, PC's litigation
            philosophy has gained
            the firm's litigators the highest respect of both the judiciary and the bar, which inures to the benefit of
            our
            litigation clients.</p>
          <p>
            While the litigation section of our practice provides a critical support function for other substantive
            areas, it is also
            a major independent activity. We actively handle a wide spectrum of business and commercial disputes for our
            corporate, business and banking clients on matters ranging from relatively simple to the most complex
            multi-party
            suits. The firm represents major insurance carriers in defense of claims in the areas of fidelity and surety
            and title insurance. We also act as counsel for companies and individuals in such areas as contract and
            commercial
            disputes, employment law matters, construction disputes, tort claims, probate contests and other chancery
            actions.</p>
          <p>Litigation, however, is a costly path to dispute resolution. Before and throughout the litigation process,
            we explore
            alternative approaches that will yield the desired results yet avoid or reduce the anxiety, expense and time
            expended by our clients as the result of lengthy litigation. Litigation should be approached aggressively
            yet
            practically. Indeed, we have in-house a former Superior Court Judge who acts as mediator/arbitrator for
            state
            court alternative dispute resolution, the American Arbitration Association and other private dispute
            resolution
            firms.
          </p>
          <p>Once your case is accepted, our sophisticated computerized litigation support system enables us to
            efficiently
            monitor both case progress and litigation expenses. You have the right to know at all times where your
            matter
            stands both financially and substantively.</p>
          <p>
            Our extensive real estate practice provides a dynamic background to support the litigation of real estate
            related matters
            including construction disputes and claims, brokerage disputes, zoning matters, land title and contractual
            based
            claims.
          </p>
          <p>Extensive representation of newspaper production and distribution interests has given us expertise and
            experience
            in highly specialized litigation involving attempts by governmental bodies to restrict the constitutional
            guarantees
            of the First Amendment.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Slower economic times in the late 1980's created a need for a loan workout team comprised of our lawyers

            Corporation and with the Resolution Trust Corporation to represent its interests as conservator and receiver

          <h5 class="grey-text text-darken-3">Guiding You Through a Complicated Process</h5>
          <p>The Elder Law Attorneys at Williams Caliri Miller &amp; Otley, PC care about the
          rights, dignity and long-term financial, mental and physical health of our senior
          citizens. In fact, you can say we are quite passionate about the subject.</p>
          <p>Williams Caliri Miller &amp; Otley, PC can help guide you or your aging loved one
          through a myriad of elder law issues such as:</p>
          <ul class="padded-list">
            <li class="circle-list">Understanding insurance plans - including Medicare &amp; Medicaid</li>
            <li class="circle-list">Surrogate decision making - guardianship</li>
            <li class="circle-list">Selecting and financing of long-term care</li>
            <li class="circle-list">Gaining access to public benefits</li>
            <li class="circle-list">Estate planning and tax issues</li>
            <li class="circle-list">Wealth preservation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Seniors have unique concerns and questions. Being elderly does not
          automatically equate to being incapacitated, but, when such issues do present
          themselves, good planning can be extremely valuable. It happens all too often
          that even well-meaning assistance can have disastrous results in this area of
          the law which is why consulting with a skilled elder law attorney is so important.
          One way of telling whether an attorney is skilled in elder law is to look for the
          CELA designation. What is a CELA? It stands for Certified Elder Law Attorney.</p>
          <p>The National Elder Law Foundation (NELF) uses CELA as the gold standard of
          elder law services. Certified Elder Law Attorneys are required to pass an
          examination, practice elder law for at least five (5) years and undergo a peer
          review every five (5) years.</p>
          <p>According to NELF, there are approximately 500 CELAs in the United States.
          Our Certified Elder Law Attorney, Jeffrey R. Bascelli, JD, has been a Certified
          Elder Law Attorney for over twenty-five (25) years and is one (1) of the original
          sixty-nine (69) Chartered Certified Elder Law Attorneys in the United States.</p>
          <p>Contact Mr. Bascelli to guide you or a loved one through the complex issues that
          can impact the long-term health and security of senior citizens.</p>
